This is a simple and very hacky thing to show a dashboard of commits
that are in the various check/gate queues. Usage is:

Usage: dash.py [options] [<username or review ID>]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u USER, --user=USER  Gerrit username
  -P PASSWD, --passwd=PASSWD
                        Gerrit password. For example, you can get this from
                        https://review.openstack.org/#/settings/
  -r REFRESH, --refresh=REFRESH
                        Refresh in seconds
  -o OWNER, --owner=OWNER
                        Show patches from this owner
  -c CHANGE, --change=CHANGE
                        Show a particular patch set.
                        Can be specified multiple times.
  -p PROJECTS, --projects=PROJECTS
                        Comma separated list of projects
  -t TOPIC, --topic=TOPIC
                        Show a particular topic only
  -w, --watched         Show changes for all watched projects
  -s, --starred         Show changes for all starred commits
  -O OPERATOR, --operator=OPERATOR
                        Join query elements with this operator (OR or AND).
                        The default is AND.
  -j, --jenkins         Show jenkins scores for patches already verified
  -Z, --dump-zuul       Dump zuul data
  -G, --dump-gerrit     Dump gerrit data

Notes:

* It used to be possible to just use your public ssh key for gerrit but with
  the latest version of dash you have to supply your password for HTTP. So if
  you are getting a 401 be sure that you are supplying the --user and --passwd
  options on the command line and that the password matches what's in your
  gerrit settings at https://review.openstack.org/#/settings/.
